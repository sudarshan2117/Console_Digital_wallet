# **Design Digital wallet console application.**
**mandatory requirements first.**
1.  **Create Wallet** – We need to accept the name of the user and the amount that should be there in the wallet for the user as inputs from the user.

2.  **Transfer Amount** – For transferring any amount, we need the sender information, the receiver information, and the amount to be transferred. And these parameters will be taken from the user.
3.  **Account Statement** – We will need to accept the account number as input. And the account statement should contain the current balance and the list of transactions the user has performed to date.
1.  **Overview** – We need no other input as it will display the current balances for all the accounts currently in the system.
2.  **Exit** – Simple to implement. No other inputs needed.
